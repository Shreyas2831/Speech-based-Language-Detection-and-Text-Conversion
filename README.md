# Speech-based-Language-Detection-and-Text-Conversion

This repository contains code for a speech-based language detection and text conversion system. The system is designed to analyze spoken input and determine the language spoken, then convert the speech into written text in the detected language. It utilizes various speech processing techniques and language models to achieve this functionality.

## Features

1. Language detection: The system is capable of identifying the language spoken in the input speech.
2. Speech-to-text conversion: Once the language is detected, the system converts the speech into written text in the detected language.
3. Multi-language support: The system supports multiple languages for speech recognition and text conversion.
4. User-friendly interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface to interact with, enabling easy input of speech and displaying the converted text.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. Speech recognition libraries.
3. Language models or datasets for speech recognition and language detection.

## Acknowledgments

1. This system utilizes the power of automatic speech recognition and language detection technologies.
2. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the libraries used in this project.
